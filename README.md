Jumubase
========

Jumubase is a tool for organizers of Germany's largest youth music competition, [Jugend musiziert][jugend-musiziert]. It is designed to eventually replace the closed-source software by the same author that currently powers [jumu-nordost.eu][jumu-nordost], the competition hub for various German schools in Europe.

The application consists of two parts:

* a data management tool accessed via different user and admin accounts
* a RESTful API for exposing public data to future web and mobile clients
